"Which keyword is used to handle exceptions in Java?","handle","catch","except","error","B","The 'catch' keyword is used along with 'try' to handle exceptions in Java. It catches and handles specific exceptions."
"What is method overriding?","Defining multiple methods with same name","Redefining parent class method in child class","Calling parent class method","Creating abstract methods","B","Method overriding is redefining a parent class method in the child class with the same signature but different implementation."
"Which loop is best for iterating over collections?","for loop","while loop","do-while loop","enhanced for loop","D","Enhanced for loop (for-each) is best for iterating over collections as it's cleaner and avoids index-related errors."
"What is the purpose of static keyword?","To make variables constant","To share members among all instances","To prevent inheritance","To make methods abstract","B","Static keyword makes members belong to the class rather than instances, so they're shared among all objects of the class."

"What is the purpose of break statement?","To exit from loops or switch","To continue to next iteration","To return from method","To throw exception","A","The break statement is used to exit from loops (for, while, do-while) or switch statements immediately."
"Which collection is synchronized by default?","ArrayList","Vector","LinkedList","HashMap","B","Vector is synchronized by default, making it thread-safe. ArrayList is not synchronized and requires external synchronization for thread safety."
"What is the difference between throw and throws?","No difference","throw is used to throw exception, throws is used to declare exception","throw declares exception, throws throws exception","Both are same","B","'throw' is used to explicitly throw an exception, while 'throws' is used in method signature to declare that method may throw exceptions."
"Which loop executes the condition check after the loop body?","for loop","while loop","do-while loop","enhanced for loop","C","Do-while loop executes the loop body first and then checks the condition, ensuring at least one execution."
